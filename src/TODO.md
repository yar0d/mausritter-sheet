- From Luis Gimeno : http://www.sinergiaderol.com/Rol/Ayudas/Mausritter/003ObjetosDeTrasfondo.rar
- Lux : https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wTh4T4CXMPgtwYqfbbmDnU4G7tEmrZvH

### Other races
Prepare for inventory extension (like for Hamster from https://sites.google.com/view/talesfrommoonshore/home/hamsters). The goal is to free space under the inventory slots. This will allow to put there specific things like the 2 cheek slots of hamsters.
- Put grit somewhere else...
- Add other races from **Player Species** by Gray Moth.

## Mobile
- Create an application really usable on tablets and smartphones.

## Misc
- Allow to roll a dice formula, like 2d6+3.
- Autosave ? after each update; each N minutes ?
- Save history in slots too.
- Manage retrieving pips from bank (cost 1% price).
- Add wonderful stuff from [Tales from Moonshore](https://sites.google.com/view/talesfrommoonshore/home)

# IDEAS
