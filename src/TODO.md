# TODO

## Extension for other races
Prepare for inventory extension (like for Hamster from https://sites.google.com/view/talesfrommoonshore/home/hamsters). The goal is to free space under the inventory slots. This will allow to put there specific things like the 2 cheek slots of hamsters.
- Move bank in a tab after welcome.
- Put grit somewhere else...
- Add other races from **Player Species** by Gray Moth.

## Mobile
Create a version usable on tablets and smartphones.

## Misc
- allow to roll a dice formula, like 2d6+3.
- Add network to allow everyone with the same table identifier to see dice rolls and other mice name.
- autosave ? after each update; each N minutes ?
- save history in slots too.
- manage draggable from bank panel to inventory slots.
- manage retrieving pips from bank (cost 1% price).
- add wonderful stuff from [Tales form Moonshore](https://sites.google.com/view/talesfrommoonshore/home)

# IDEAS
- Application for GM session sheet
- VTT with space deck ?

# FUTURE
- manage inventory dropping collision with card geometry.
- auto arrange inventory.
- add a mouse picture with current equipment.
