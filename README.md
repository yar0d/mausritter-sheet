Depending on what you want, you can build a docker container or a desktop application.

## For developpers
This application is made with [Vue.js 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) and [wave-ui](https://antoniandre.github.io/wave-ui/).

For desktop application, I use [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/).

```
npm ci
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve

### Compile and hot-reloads for desktop application
